The memory game consists of a word list of all possible words used in the game, another list of random words taken from that big list 
for the user to match to, and then an interface for handling user input called "wordstream", along with a means of matching user 
input to the list of words.  

Populating Word List
---
Vectors contain the words that get displayed to the screen.  These words must be memorized by the player in order to get a high score.

Word Populate Functions

random_word loops to check a random integer of maximum value equal to size of word_list, and uses that as the element 
of word_list vector.  This gives a random word.  It then checks if the word is a repeat, and if 
that check is false, it will return the word.  If the check is true, then the word is not returned and random_word finds a 
different word to work with.

checkrepeat starts by assuming that userguess is false, and loops through word_round.  word_round is a list of words that user 
has guessed already, which populates itself during gameplay.  checkrepeat checks if wordstr, the word that user has guessed in 
the present execution of checkrepeat is equal to any word in word_round.  If true, then checkrepeat returns true, if not, it 
returns false.
